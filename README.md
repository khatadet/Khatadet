```
## WORK EXPERIENCE FULL TIME
### Full Stack Developer, Dexian, Seagate Technology 
### Jan 2025 - Present
- Developed both backend and frontend web applications to meet specific business requirements, modernizing the existing work-notification and job-management system from C# .NET to Vue.js, adding new features, and deploying to Kubernetes.
- Designed and implemented a proxy API to enable seamless, secure communication between Grafana Alerting and Apache DolphinScheduler.
- Built ETL programs in Python to ingest data from Kafka into InfluxDB v2, transformed raw data into a time-series–friendly structure, optimized for multithreaded processing, and deployed the pipeline on Kubernetes.
- Implemented data-ingestion flows from manufacturing machines to enterprise databases from multiple sources, including file-based FTP ingestion, on-machine services that push data to Kafka, and forwarding Kafka data into the enterprise bus (data stream).
- Developed C#–based data stream analytics to monitor machine sensor values in real time, preventing product and machine damage; delivered more than 30 sensor-checking modules on top of distributed data.
- Designed and improved Grafana alerting rule generation using InfluxDB as the data source, migrating from a legacy, resource-heavy solution to a more lightweight, maintainable alerting setup.
- Set up a PaaS environment on Linux VMs, including database configuration and centralized authentication using Home AD (LDAP), for both development and production environments.
- Configured a Grafana cluster to let developers create dashboards and alerting rules with role-based access control via LDAP, and integrated shared services such as SMTP, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, and InfluxDB to support flexible application development.
- Set up a Zookeeper cluster to support PaaS components that require clustering, such as DolphinScheduler or Flink.
- Deployed and configured a DolphinScheduler cluster so developers can build workflows for alert handling (e.g. from Grafana) and for scheduled batch jobs.


### Research assistant, Computer Engineering SUT								Mar 2024 - Dec 2024
- Prepared and maintained research-related documentation end to end, including project files, official forms, and progress reports to comply with university and Ministry of Higher Education requirements.
- Developed an internal website/system to organize research projects, store research documents by category, track project finances, and provide project-status visibility for principal investigators.
- Produced periodic research progress reports and supporting documents for submission to the university and external authorities.
- Drafted documentation for utility model/petty patent or IP filings based on team inventions, including drawing specifications and relevant references.
- Assisted in preparing medical research ethics documents (IRB/EC) for studies involving human subjects or retrospective patient data, including sample-size specification, study procedures, informed-consent documentation, and workflow planning.
- Coordinated among sub-teams and researchers to clarify requirements, remove duplicated tasks, and ensure smooth collaboration across the project.
- Liaised with external stakeholders such as hospitals, intellectual property offices, and medical ethics committees to facilitate and accelerate research operations.
- Supported outreach and communication activities to recruit research participants/volunteers according to project criteria.
- Organized research meetings, took minutes, and produced concise summaries so that PIs and researchers who could not attend could still follow the project status.
- Scheduled and rescheduled meetings across multiple organizations with differing timetables to ensure regular project follow-ups.

### Internship assistant engineer, Magnecomp Precision Technology PCL	 		DEC 2021- APR 2022
- Assisted in developing organization-oriented web applications using C# .NET and Angular, practicing software analysis, system design, and basic team coordination.
- Built a web-based data import feature to upload Excel files and automatically load/transform the data into the database, reducing manual data-entry effort.
- Developed an employee certificate/qualification tracking module that allows responsible departments to view certification status and sends notifications to supervisors when staff need to renew their certificates.
- Helped upgrade two separate Windows-based KIOSK applications into a unified solution to simplify maintenance and improve user experience.
- Enhanced the KIOSK system with features that allow employees to view their own payment or benefit information directly through the kiosk.

## WORK EXPERIENCE PART TIME
### Teaching assistant, Computer Engineering SUT								AUG 2022 - Dec 2024
- Assisted in conducting laboratory sessions for programming and systems courses, including Problem Solving with Programming, Computer Programming, and Object-Oriented Technology
- Prepared lab materials, exercises, and sample code; guided students on debugging techniques and effective use of development tools
- Supported hands-on courses in web and data-related subjects, such as Advanced Web Application Development, Database Systems, and Introduction to Data Engineering
- Graded assignments, programming tasks, and lab reports, and provided constructive feedback to improve student performance
- Facilitated lab activities for infrastructure-oriented courses, including Operating Systems and Computer Networks, ensuring students understood experiments and could operate lab equipment
- Provided out-of-class support (onsite/online) and coordinated with the course instructor to monitor student progress

### Research assistant, NECTEC	 												MAY 2022 - APR 2023
- Participated in a research project on human motion analysis using AI-based pose estimation to compare body keypoints between instructor and trainee
- Applied mathematical algorithms—including cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and angular difference—to quantify the similarity between two human movements
- Assisted in preparing, refining, and cleaning the instructor–trainee dance dataset for comparative experiments
- Contributed to results analysis and interpretation, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each similarity metric
- Research work was published under the title “A Comparison of the Instructor-Trainee Dance Dataset Using Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Angular difference”
